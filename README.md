## Fira Code: monospaced font with programming ligatures

### Problem

Programmers use a lot of symbols, often encoded with several characters. For human brain sequences like `->`, `<=` or `:=` are single logical token, even if they take two or three places on the screen. Your eye spends non-zero amount of evergy to scan, parse and join multiple characters into a single logical one. Ideally, all programming languages should be designed with full-fledged Unicode symbols for operators, but thatâ€™s not the case yet.

### Solution

Fira Code is a Fira Mono font extended with a set of ligatures for common programming multi-character combinations. This is just a font rendering feature: underlying code remains ASCII-compatible. This helps to read and understand code faster. For some frequent sequences like `..` or `//` ligatures allow us to correct spacing.

### Credits

This work is based on OFL-licensed [Fira Mono font](https://github.com/mozilla/Fira). Original Fira Mono font was not changed, only extended.

Fira Code was inspired by [Hasklig font](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig): Ligatures for Haskell code
